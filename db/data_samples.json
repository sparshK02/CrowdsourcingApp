Let me just say, I have looked at all the crib bedding at high-end establishments such as Babies R Us, and was NOT impressed. This set was just great - both in aesthetics AND quality. It feels plush, soft, and just wonderful for my little boy to sleep in. He hates ever being away from home (such as his trips to grandma's) because he enjoys his own comfortable bed so much..which I attribute to both his mattress and especially, this bedding.

I think i got ripped off because for one this bedding set is cuter than my other sons and two it cost $250 less. I am 35 weeks pregnant so my son hasn't been able to sleep in his new bed yet due to him not here but i bet he sleeps just as good as my other kids did with their high priced bedding sets. Also if you are a expecting mother and getting a new baby bed i recommend a dark color baby bed. I bought the Graco - Lauren 4-in-1 Convertible Classic Fixed Side Crib, Espresso and it matches perfectly with the bedding set. I love the bed and the bedding set. Both are great products.

The only reason I didn't give \"value\" all 5 stars is because the crib sheet does feel quite starchy, but I'm hoping that few washings will soften it up... I was expecting it, though, because I'd already read about it in other reviews.

I purposely got this set because it came with a dust ruffle. Also, the dust ruffle does not seem to fit our standard crib as well as it is shown in the picture.

Then I tried dusting it lightly with baby powder (as I found on the internet as a solution). Still strong odor. Put it back outside for another week. Thought it was some better so I made the mistake of bringing it in and trying to sleep on it. STILL STRONG ODOR! Was also too high & too firm. For anyone with neck problems or has had neck surgery, like I have, please be careful. It is just too high for proper neck alignment, especially if you have a rather short neck.

I prefer two pillows and I think it is the perfect pillow with the combination of two pillows together. I like to sleep with one to the side and one at the head of the bed but with these I just have used both bc one is great but two is amazing. I don't understand just having one pillow it's foreign to me. I have sciatica and severe back pain nerve issues and I am so surprised today I didn't wake up with a migraine or just headache. My neck didn't hurt. I get muscle spasms and contractures. I was going to get a memory foam pillow but I like the plush feeling of pillows and would rather my mattress be memory foam so I tried these pillows.

It is like a down alternative pillow mixed with memory foam fibers from the packaging I read. I bought four queen sized pillows for me and my fianc\u00e9 and we love them. I prefer two pillows and I think it is the perfect pillow with the combination of two pillows together. I like to sleep with one to the side and one at the head of the bed but with these I just have used both bc one is great but two is amazing. I don't understand just having one pillow it's foreign to me. I have sciatica and severe back pain nerve issues and I am so surprised today I didn't wake up with a migraine or just headache. My neck didn't hurt. I get muscle spasms and contractures. I was going to get a memory foam pillow but I like the plush feeling of pillows and would rather my mattress be memory foam so I tried these pillows.

Instead, I bought the $3 pillows and threw them out every 6 months or so because they'd be completely flat.  It's been about 6 years since I got my latex pillows and they are the same now as when I bought them.  They're actually going to save me money in the long run, even being as expensive as they are.In addition to the above, they are head and shoulders above (no pun intended) any other pillow I've tried.  It's like laying your head down on a cloud of heaven.  There's no waiting for the thing to warm up before it contours to your head like memory foam.  There are no lumpy areas or hard spots like traditional pillows.  It's not excessively hard like so many pillows are.  I frankly do not understand why they are not more popular as they are the best type of pillow made.This specific pillow is a mid-loft type and would work for a back or side sleeper.  If you're one of those weird stomach sleepers, you want something with a lower loft.  (Habitat Furnishings has a perfect one for you; I returned it because it was too low for me, being a side sleeper.)  Latex is a different feel, being springy and almost bouncy, but it's unbeatable once you get used to it.  It's also not hot like memory foam.I now sleep on an all-latex mattress and no longer have to take prescriptions for joint pain as it all went away when I got my bed.  Another benefit is that it's all-natural - basically, whipped and cooked tree sap.  There are a plethora of chemicals in other types of foam, many of which the government admits they don't know what effect expose has on humans.You really cannot beat the comfort, longevity, or price of this pillow.  WalMart made the buying process easy and easily beat the next lower retailer.  I was a bit hesitant to order, never having bought from walmart.com before, but it was smooth and simple.  I have spent over twice as much on another latex pillow in the past, but this one feels identical.  (I bought it for my father and tested it before giving it to him.)  If anything happens to my beloved latex pillows, I am coming back here to order replacements."

These pillows have approximately a 10-20 year life span in my experience. They provide excellent neck support while still having enough give to make it comfortbale. They are soft and bouncy, and the latex remains evenly distributed no matter what you do to the pillow, so it never gets lumpy or bent out of shape. The pillow stays cool at night, too, which I love. I did notice that the pillow took about 3-5 days to \"break in\" for me in comparison to my ancient one. During the break in period it was a little to \"high\", but it compacted in a few days and is perfect now.I tried all manner of other pillows before I was able to find this one at Walmart.com. Obviously pillows come down to personal preference, but if you want a firm, yet soft and springy pillow with good neck support and aren't a fan of the firmness of foam or the lumpyness of feathers/down and polyester/cotton then this is the pillow for you! The latex is excellent quality, other latex pillows I've tried and returned have had too much give at the expense of neck support and just FEEL flimsy. When this pillow finally does start wearing down, the latex inside will begin to crumble, but this won't be noticeable because it is inside a case and that case is probably in a pillow case. I'd just say check it in about 15 years. ;)"

If you want to warm the bottle place it in a bowl of warm water or hold it under warm tap water. Shake the bottle gently and then test the temp making sure it's warm and not hot. Don't ever heat the bottle in a microwave because the formula can get hot really fast and burn your baby's mouth! Let us know if you have any other questions. ~The Similac Team",

I was up with him crying an average of 20 hours each day and was frantic to find something to help him feel better and be happy.I don't produce enough breast milk and had to supplement with gerber formula. Once on formula he started having trouble moving his bowels and was much fussier than before. After about a week on the different gerber formulas, he refused to drink them.

Rather it is intended to pour the desired amount into a separate bottle for feeding then cover and refrigerate the remainder for up to 48 hours. Look for Enfamil A.R. in our 2oz Nursette Bottles. Our Nursette Bottles are nipple-ready for easy feeding. Many standard or classic nipples available at retail will fit our Nursette bottles. I hope that this helps! -Ashley"

From there, we were told try Similac Alimentum, it was better than the Nurtamigen, but they were still having issues with diarrhea and spitting up. We decided we don't need to visit the doctor, to try a new formula, so we went with the Similac Soy. It was okay, but the diarrhea was still there. Now we are solely on Similac for Spit Up, and it is amazing!!! Our girls haven't been more content, and neither have had diarrhea or spit up. Like many have stated, the formula is thicker, so using the Dr. Brown's nipple size 2 has been our best solution!! If we try to make the bottle by hand, it's a little foamy, but if you plan ahead, it all settles.

From there, we were told try Similac Alimentum, it was better than the Nurtamigen, but they were still having issues with diarrhea and spitting up. We decided we don't need to visit the doctor, to try a new formula, so we went with the Similac Soy. It was okay, but the diarrhea was still there. Now we are solely on Similac for Spit Up, and it is amazing!!! Our girls haven't been more content, and neither have had diarrhea or spit up.

The shelf life is chosen to assure that the vitamins in our products will routinely meet the label claims until the Expiration or Use By date. Products are shipped from our warehouse with sufficient shelf life remaining to allow for normal movement through distribution channels. To ensure the highest quality product the shelf life of our products is reviewed on an ongoing basis. Consequently the shelf life for a specific product may vary from batch to batch and we are unable to provide a date.

I was going to let it go as wrong info on advertisment but my purchase summary did show a complete order for 6 cans at 7.18 as well as an email confirmation stating a 6 pk as well. So I did call their customer service and I thought I was going to have to argue my point ( I thought they would tell me come on who really expects 6 32oz ready to serve formula for $7.18 ) but nope with out hassle andno questions asked they had another shipment of 6 cans sent out to me without charge :) I'm a satisfied customer and will order again and hope my next purchases are of the complete 6 pk. 1 32oz can is enough for my 8 month old son in one day as he eats baby foods/cereal as well.

Prebiotics support growth of beneficial gut bacteria that may help support a baby's immune system. Babies fed infant formula having prebiotics may have softer stools more like those of a breastfed baby. I hope that this helps! -Ashley"

My second I Breastfed and because I never produce a lot of milk I used Similac and really liked it. With this baby I also breastfed and used the Similac, however my baby was so gassy and uncomfortable I decided to switch formula. I switched to Enfamil Gentlease and although she got better gas wise she became constipated if I didn't mix it with the breast milk which also caused her pain. I recently stopped pumping so I decided I had to switch again since I didn't want her to be always constipated. I tried the Enfamil Newborn and after three days she is finally pooping regularly AND more importantly it is the same consistency as when she drinks the breast milk. She no longer looks like she is straining to poop. Also the smell of the poop smells just like when she drank the breast milk. I AM LOVING IT. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it has only been about four days. My baby is 10 weeks old and I intend to use it until she is 16 weeks old then I will switch to Premium Lipil. Also some complained about the new packaging but it hasn't been a problem for me. I just pour the contents of the bag into the tub and we are good to go.

The results of these tests form the basis for establishing the Expiration (EXP) or Use By date. The shelf life and Expiration (EXP) or Use By dates are based on normal conditions of storage and distribution. The primary factors that limit shelf life are physical stability such as color and the natural gradual decrease in the potency of some of the vitamins. The shelf life is chosen to assure that the vitamins in our products will routinely meet the label claims until the Expiration or Use By date. Products are shipped from our warehouse with sufficient shelf life remaining to allow for normal movement through distribution channels. We must rely on store personnel to stock their shelves and periodically review the Expiration (EXP) or Use By dates on products. I hope this helps! ~Cindi"

Failure to follow these instructions could result in sever harm. Talk to (or consult) your baby's doctor about the appropriate formula for your baby. Powdered infant formulas are not sterile and should not be fed to premature infants or infants who might have immune problems unless directed and supervised by your baby's doctor. Always wash your hands and utensils before preparing formula. Sterilization or boiling of tap or bottled water and sterilization of utensils is recommended. Your doctor will advise if it is not required. If boiling water bring to a rolling boil for 1 minute and allow to cool to room temperature before preparing formula. Step 1 Pour desired amount of water into bottle. Step 2 Add 1 unpacked level scoop (8.9g) of powder for each 2 fl. oz. of water (Only use enclosed scoop.) Step 3 Cap bottle; Shake well. Feed baby immediately. Once feeding begins use contents within 1 hour or discard. Makes approximately 164 fl. oz. (1.3 gal) of formula. Warming formula above or using water warmer than 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) will compromise the probiotic cultures."

This size can lasts us about 6 days. I just put five ounces of water in the bottle then add two and a half scoops and shake really really good swirl the bottle at the end to pop as many bubbles as possible and then let it sit for a minute or two. Your supposed to burp between every ounce but my baby pitches way to much of a fit and I burp every two ounces then for the last ounce. This formula is amazing for my little one hope it works well for you!"

She doesn't seem to be spitting up or extra gassy or bothered by it, does the foamy texture not really matter in the end?"
